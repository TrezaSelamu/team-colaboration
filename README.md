# Login Form

## Project Overview
This project features a basic HTML login form with accompanying CSS styling. It provides a user-friendly interface for entering login credentials, with additional styling for responsiveness and visual appeal.

## Installation
1. Copy the entire HTML code.
2. Paste it into a new or existing HTML file using a text editor (e.g., Notepad, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).
3. Save the file with an ".html" extension (e.g., "login_form.html").
4. Ensure the "img_avatar2.png" image is available in the specified location or replace it with your desired image.
5. Host the HTML file on a web server that supports server-side scripting for full functionality.

## Usage
1. Open the HTML file in a web browser to view and interact with the login form.
2. Enter a username and password into the designated fields.
3. Click the "Login" button to submit the form.
4. Optionally, use the "Remember me" checkbox.
5. The form is set to submit data to a server-side script named "action_page.php" using the POST method. Implement the server-side logic for processing user input.

## Documentation
