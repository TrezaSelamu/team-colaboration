### Run tests

To run tests, run the following command:
PHP Tests:
Locate the PHP test suite in the project. This is usually in a dedicated tests/ or test/ directory.
Identify the test runner or framework being used, such as PHPUnit, Codeception, or Laravel's built-in testing tools.
Run the PHP tests using the appropriate command for the test framework, for example:
Copy
# Using PHPUnit
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/
JavaScript Tests:
Locate the JavaScript test suite in the project. This may be in a tests/ or __tests__/ directory.
Determine the test runner or framework being used, such as Jest, Mocha, or Cypress.
Run the JavaScript tests using the appropriate command for the test framework, for example:
Copy
# Using Jest
npm run test
End-to-End (E2E) Tests:
If the project includes end-to-end tests, these may be written in JavaScript and use a tool like Selenium, Cypress, or Puppeteer.
Locate the E2E test suite and run the tests using the appropriate command for the framework.
### Deployment
Follow these steps to deploy the Adila Hotel website to your production environment:

Prepare the Deployment Package:
Ensure that you have the latest version of the Adila Hotel website code.
Create a deployment package by compressing the entire website directory (e.g., adila-hotel-website.zip).
Transfer the Deployment Package:
Using a secure file transfer method (e.g., SFTP, SCP), upload the deployment package to your production server.
Transfer the package to the appropriate directory on the server, such as /var/www/html/ on Linux or C:\inetpub\wwwroot\ on Windows.
Extract the Deployment Package:
Log in to your production server using the deployment user account.
Navigate to the directory where you uploaded the deployment package.
Extract the contents of the package using the appropriate command for your operating system (e.g., unzip adila-hotel-website.zip on Linux, Expand-Archive adila-hotel-website.zip -DestinationPath . on Windows).
Configure the Database:
Create a new database for the Adila Hotel website on your production server.
Open the config.php file located in the includes directory.
Update the database connection details (host, username, password, database name) with your production server's credentials.
Set up the Web Server:
Ensure that the web server has the necessary permissions to access and execute the PHP scripts.
Configure the web server to serve the Adila Hotel website files. This may involve setting up a virtual host or modifying the server's document root.
Initialize the Database:
Open a web browser and navigate to the install.php file in your website's directory (e.g., https://www.adilahotel.com/install.php).
Follow the on-screen instructions to set up the initial database structure and administrator account.
Test the Deployment:
Open a web browser and navigate to the Adila Hotel website using the production domain (e.g., https://www.adilahotel.com).
Verify that the website is accessible and functioning correctly.
