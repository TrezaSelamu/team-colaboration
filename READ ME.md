PHP 8.0: A popular server-side scripting language used for the dynamic functionality of the website.
JavaScript: A client-side scripting language used for interactivity and user experience enhancement.
CSS: The style sheet language used for describing the presentation of the web pages.
Database
MySQL 8.0: The relational database management system used for storing and managing hotel data.



Testing and Quality Assurance
PHPUnit: A unit testing framework for PHP.


PHP_CodeSniffer: A tool that detects violations of a defined set of coding standards.
Other Tools and Services
Git: The distributed version control system used for managing the project's codebase.
GitHub: The code hosting and collaboration platform used for the project's repository.


The combination of these technologies and tools allows the Adila Hotel Management System to provide a robust, scalable, and user-friendly hotel management solution, leveraging the strengths of HTML, PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and MySQL.

Using a secure file transfer method (e.g., SFTP, SCP), upload the deployment package to your production server.
Transfer the package to the appropriate directory on the server, such as /var/www/html/ on Linux or C:\inetpub\wwwroot\ on Windows.
Extract the Deployment Package:
Log in to your production server using the deployment user account.
Navigate to the directory where you uploaded the deployment package.
Extract the contents of the package using the appropriate command for your operating system (e.g., unzip adila-hotel-website.zip on Linux, Expand-Archive adila-hotel-website.zip -DestinationPath . on Windows).
Configure the Database:
Create a new database for the Adila Hotel website on your production server.
Open the config.php file located in the includes directory.
Update the database connection details (host, username, password, database name) with your production server's credentials.
Set up the Web Server:
Ensure that the web server has the necessary permissions to access and execute the PHP scripts.
Configure the web server to serve the Adila Hotel website files. This may involve setting up a virtual host or modifying the server's document root.
